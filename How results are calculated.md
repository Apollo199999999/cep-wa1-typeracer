# How the metrics in the "Results" dialog shown at the end of the game are calculated
The following points detail how the metrics in the "Results" dialog shown at the end of the game are calculated:
* Total characters typed: The total number of characters from **all** of the words that the user has typed, including spaces.
* Correct characters typed: The total number of characters from **all** of the words that the user has typed, including spaces.
* WPM: The typing speed of the user, calculated by dividing the correct characters typed by 5. The result is then divided by the time taken in minutes and rounded to 2 decimal places if necessary.
* Raw WPM: The raw typing speed of the user, calculated by dividing the total characters typed by 5. The result is then divided by the time taken in minutes and rounded to 2 decimal places if necessary.
* Accuracy: The percentage of words that the user has typed correctly, calculated by dividing the correct characters typed by the total characters typed. The result is then multiplied by 100% and rounded to 2 decimal places if necessary.
